# Contributing and communications
- Please do not submit patches/pull requests without talking about it first.
- Main needs and plans for the project are communicated with GitHub issues.
- Your opinions and suggestions are very kindly welcome! (Agreement not guaranteed though ðŸ™ƒ)
- Currently the main channel **for suggestions** is email (see below) or GitHub issues. We will think of opening a mailing list
and/or a IRC/Matrix room *(or something different but open and reasonable)* if there's a need for it.
- Get in touch especially if you use, or seriously want to use, the software: **write an email** to contact@actualscan.com.
Do communicate your needs, so they can be taken into account in new features and you can get info on important changes.
(Note that this is *only* good will and best effort, as ActualScan is currently developed completely for free.)
