    "text": "Of course, it does.\nBecause contrary what you've just said, in recent years we've actually seen a shift with advertisers seeking out magazines and platforms with a dedicated and engaged demographic, although small.\nDon't be mistaken, engagement is still key for sustainable advertising.\nWhat you're referring to is the type of advertiser who needs a hit or exposure regardless of where it's coming from or whether it will match their audience.\nThat idea is archaic, and it's precisely why American Vogue's ad lineup will be the highest in March or September, filled with everything from Colgate to Vuitton to Peter Roth Thomas to obscure Brazilian brands which the magazine doesn't even shoot to malls (ads for malls!), and the lowest in January and June because guess what, all those advertisers don't bother to return during months where there won't be a lot of noise in the pages of Vogue.\n\nTo use UK Harper's Bazaar as an example again, they run on a very defined aesthetic which is great for their existing advertisers because they can bet on the same reader returning month after month, consuming every inch of the magazine.\nSaid aesthetic does mean that Harper's will miss out on a very specific set of advertisers.\nThey align themselves with those who share their aesthetic or lifestyle.\nIt's the reason why you will not see the likes of Victoria's Secret, Calvin Klein underwear or hypebeast brands in the magazine, brands who do advertise in Vogue.\nHarper's didn't even shoot Saint Laurent until very recently (you won't find the ads in their magazine either), and even then, the most conservative looks are selected for their content.\nAnd yet despite all that, the magazine's page count still exceeds that of Vogue during certain months, and still manage to see growth year after year.\nSo no, niche magazines (websites, influencers!) are still able to court advertising and as shown with Harper's, it can be very successful with the right approach.",

    "text": "Among the expertly angled selfies, #sponsored posts and and plugs for Fenty Beauty on Stephanie Shepherd's Instagram is a pastel purple graphic overlayed with a trendy, '70s-inspired font: \"Laundry is 35% of microplastic pollution.\"\n\nIn the caption, Shepherd \u2014 \"Steph Shep\" to friends and 1.5 million followers, some of whom may know her as the former executive assistant of Kim Kardashian West \u2014 explains that washing fabrics like polyester and nylon releases microplastics (\"bad stuff\") into the ocean.\nBut, she says, there are ways to make laundry day less of an environmental burden, like using a Guppyfriend Washing Bag or a Cora Ball to capture said microplastics.\n\nI bought the Cora Ball.\nI was eco-influenced by Steph Shep.\n\nSince stepping down from her position as the Chief Operating Officer of Kardashian West Brands in 2018, the fashion and beauty influencer has turned her attention to the environment.\nShepherd is the co-founder of climate education platform Future Earth , an advisor to nonprofit organization Khana and a plastic-free columnist at Poosh .\nShe is a climate 'activist' of the Kardashian generation \u2014 that is, if eco-influencing equals activism.\n\nDoes it?\nIs it possible to be both an \"activist\" and a \"luxury tastemaker,\" as Shepherd describes herself in her official bio?\nCan encouraging followers to buy the Cora Ball justify encouraging them to buy single-use under-eye masks , or a lip plumper in a plastic tube or leggings made out of the aforementioned microplastic-shedding nylon ?\n\nMaybe not, but that's kind of Steph Shep's brand.\n\n\"It can be really difficult and is something I think about daily,\" Shepherd tells Fashionista of balancing her work as an influencer and her work as an environmentalist.\n\"There's a quote I love to reference: 'We don't need a handful of people doing this perfectly, we need millions of people doing this imperfectly.'\"\u00a0\n\nShe isn't after the zero-wasters committed to the cause.\nShe's after the majority, and meets them where they're at: social media.\n\n\"I always wanted to share the information I would find that could help others learn more about the world around us, but it often read as corporate or too science \u2014 nothing approachable for people to view and understand with ease,\" Shepherd says.\n\"So I thought, why not create an educational platform specifically targeting and aesthetically appealing to our friends?\"\u00a0\n\nThat thought turned into Future Earth, the Instagram account Shepherd launched last year with city planner and MIT alum Max Moinian.\n(Sample post: a global warming heat map captioned, \"It's going to be hot as f*ck by 2050.\")\u00a0\n\n\"We definitely try to target millennials and Gen Z, and really anyone on social media who is a consumer,\" the founder shares.\n\nIt's a wide net to cast, almost a counterintuitive one: We can't consume our way out of climate change.\n\"That being said, we each play a role in the consumer culture that can be unavoidable,\" the Future Earth founder levels \u2014 and what better way to educate consumers than by infiltrating the content they're already consuming?\n\nIn a recent trend report for Elle.com , Shepherd declared tiny sunglasses out, and reusable glass straws in.\nA 2018 profile of her beauty routine on Into the Gloss featured no fewer than 18 skin-care products, 18 makeup products and five body care products \u2014 but in her latest for Harper's Bazaar , she declares herself a converted minimalist, \"a two-product girl.\"\nThese small, almost sneaky plugs for sustainability are strategic.\nThe goal?\nTo inspire mass amounts of imperfect action.\n\nI recently caught up with Shepherd to discuss her post-Kardashian climate work, conscious consumerism and activism beyond Instagram.\nAhead, the highlights from our conversation.\n\n\"Steph Shep\" has almost become synonymous with \"the Kardashians.\"\nHow did you first start working for Kim, and what prompted you to step down from such a prominent position \u2014 COO of Kardashian West Brands \u2014 and branch out on your own?\n\nI started working for Kim right when I turned 23.\nI learned firsthand everything from starting and running a business to the production of a TV show to building apps and the underworkings of social media marketing.\nThe experience was invaluable, and at the end of about four and a half years, it was simply time to graduate.\n\nWhat did you learn from working with Kim about being an influencer, and how does that inform how you approach being a public figure now?\n\nWell, I have one of the best mentors in the world in that regard.\nI have learned that grace and resilience are essential.\nAnd at the end of the day, you just have to stay true to who you are and confidently humble.\n\nWas there one specific moment that you realized you had influence on your own?\n\nI think when people come up to me on the street and tell me they love what I am doing with Future Earth, it really hits!\nI wasn't sure how people would respond, but I love that people are interested in more than just the makeup and skin-care products I use.\nI feel very fortunate that I've been able to create a platform that allows me to share my passions and spread awareness about social and environmental issues facing the world today.\n\nWhen did the environment start becoming a larger priority for you?\nWas there a specific article you read or a statistic you heard that flipped the switch?\n\nSince my childhood.\nI remember participating in school activities for Earth Day and learning about science and biodiversity.\nMore recently, Former Vice President Al Gore's documentary, \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" lit a fire in me.\nAfter that film, my passion for environmental conservation was reinforced.\nI realized that I wanted and needed to do my part to help.\n\nHow do you reconcile the tension that exists in being an influencer \u2014 promoting clothing and beauty products and, on some level, consumerism \u2014 and being a sustainability advocate?\n\nAs I've become more aware and committed to various social and environmental causes, I've learned about harmful chemicals found in beauty and skin-care products, wasteful packaging and other business practices that need to change.\n\nI work hard to support brands with missions that align with my ethics.\nBut rather than saying no to a brand that doesn't fully align, I find that when I have the opportunity to speak with the brand and build a relationship, I can leverage my influence to share information and concerns I have and hopefully that can create change.\n\nStephanie Shepherd.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Stephanie Shepherd\n\nWhen I collaborated with JBrand Jeans and designed the #LittleBlueJean, the denim was made using an eco wash process that utilized 90% less water, on average.\n[Editor's note: A representative for J Brand tells Fashionista, \"The 90% refers to 90% less than J Brand's historical average.\"] With the #LittleBlueJean, I was able to be a part of one of JBrand's first designs using an eco wash.\nIt was a great way to bridge the gap between fashion and conscious consumerism.\u00a0\n\nYou talk a lot about \"conscious consumerism,\" which has always struck me as a bit of an oxymoron.\nHow do you define conscious consumerism?\n\nOn a micro level, consumers are responsible for their actions, and everyone has an environmental footprint.\nBut there is power in our choices, and we can choose to make decisions that align with our ideals.\n\nBeing a conscious consumer to me means actively considering the impact of my purchases on my health, my community and the environment.\nI aim to support brands that align with my standards, adopt sustainable business practices and consider public health and their environmental footprint.\n\nHow do you approach the subject of sustainability and eco-consciousness with your peers and members of your own community \u2014 influencers and celebrities who have more, uh, excessive lifestyles?\n\nThe greatest challenge with this is to not shut people out who may have different lifestyles or outlooks on life but to help be a catalyst for change.\nIt's something as simple as creating a means for conversation.\u00a0While I do my best to lead by example and demonstrate eco-consciousness in my own choices, I also acknowledge that people will always have their own opinion and I respect that.\u00a0\n\nHaving the patience to understand and listen to someone who may not agree with the Green New Deal or a zero-waste lifestyle, for example, is just as important to me as speaking out.\nIf we don't hear all sides of an argument we can't properly act or find solutions to the problem.\n\nI'm curious if you have a set of standards that help you determine the companies you'll work with now, whether that's sustainable materials, or no fast fashion or carbon neutrality.\n\nSustainability is always something I take into consideration when I am partnering with brands.\nHowever, at the moment, our world is in a transition period.\nThere are initiatives in the works for companies I work with that haven't come to fruition yet, but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop working with them.\nI get to have an inside look into how these major corporations are beginning to make the internal changes necessary to do their part to transition to a more eco-conscious environment.\nIt gives me hope, but change takes time.\u00a0\n\nThis new wave of \"cancel culture\" online where people immediately dismiss others based off of one seemingly contradictory action alone is not helpful to anyone.\nThere is so much happening behind the scenes.\nI still get in my gas-fueled car with my reusable water bottle in tow.\n\nHow did Future Earth first come about, and what was your vision for it?\n\nMax and I have mutual friends.\nWhen they started seeing the work I was doing with the Climate Reality Project , a friend reached out and connected us.\nI ran the idea by Max, and she was more than excited to bring the idea to life.\nShe is brilliant, extraordinarily academic and a master at graphic design.\nWhen you pair that with what I know about social media marketing and outreach, it makes us a really good team.\n\nStephanie Shepherd.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Stephanie Shepherd\n\nThe tone that Future Earth takes is really unique to the space.\nWhat's your strategy for speaking to millennials and Gen Z?\n\nThe team at Future Earth came to a common consensus that there can be a lack of well-delivered and engaging information out there that spans a lot of topics when it comes to consumerism and the environment.\nWe understand the importance of delivery and relatability when it comes to the way we post or share information on Future Earth.\u00a0\n\nWe need to talk about and share information that will not only hit home with people but will be easy for all people to understand, which is something we felt a lot of climate activist groups neglected.\nThe hard thing about explaining climate change is that the effects sometimes aren't super tangible.\nSome people can have a hard time grasping what 500 tonnes of CO2 actually is, or the gravity of a glacier melting.\nBut when you talk about the impacts of fast fashion through images of clothing factories or relate climate change to someone's health, that can get people listening.\n\nThere's often a lot of shame associated with environmental activism.\nFuture Earth takes the opposite approach.\nYour posts are always informative, sometimes funny, never shame-y.\nIs that a conscious choice?\n\nYes, absolutely.\nWe don't support doomsday activism nor do we believe it is effective.\nWe actually think it can do the opposite and deter people because it can make tackling environmental issues, like climate change, seem unbelievably daunting and terrifying.\n\nWe want to foster a united community for people to come together for climate change education \u2014 where no one feels shame if they don't know something.\nWe are all learning and working toward a common goal: to enact change for a healthier future.\nJust because climate change is a serious problem doesn't mean we can't treat it with hope.\n\nAre there any plans to expand the Future Earth platform beyond social media?\nHow do you get people to go beyond clicking \"like\" or \"share\" and affect real change?\n\nYes!\nWe have already put our organization to work in Los Angeles.\nWe had our first event in November and partnered with the environmental nonprofit TreePeople .\nWe were able to bring together a group of people to plant trees in the Santa Monica Mountains.\n\nWe have more plans for 2020 to engage the Future Earth community and enact large-scale initiatives as well.\nWe want to hold smaller discussions about climate change in local communities, and host panels, educational presentations and more giveback events.\n\nSince creating Future Earth, we've found that people want to get involved in climate change initiatives, but they may not know where to start.\n\nWe are working on creating a community that is welcoming, adequately educated and approachable, so people want to join the cause.\nThat is the basis for the change we want to see happen.\nWe want to somewhat redefine the face of the environmentalist to be an everyday person, so everyone knows they have a place in the movement.\n\nFuture Earth recently got involved with World War Zero.\nWhat does that mean for the brand?\n\nWorld War Zero is a new coalition established by former Senator and Secretary of State John Kerry.\nIt is one of the newer initiatives I have joined forces with alongside many remarkable world leaders and activists, military leaders, Hollywood figures and more.\nDespite our different backgrounds, we have united over a common goal: Engage and educate people on today's critical environmental issues to enact change and create a healthier planet for future generations.\n\nOur message focuses on innovation, technology, job creation, national security and much more and the coalition aims to implement large-scale public education, content and community-by-community efforts to promote climate change awareness as a public priority.\n\nI'm hopeful about the change we will be able to bring forth using our knowledge and social platforms for something bigger than ourselves.\nIn the coming months, the coalition will be hosting a number of events and town halls throughout the country.\nYou can find out more about how to get involved with World War Zero on their website .\n\nFinally, what are some easy and impactful ways readers can make their current fashion and beauty routines more sustainable?\n\nFirst, resell your clothes and buy secondhand .\nAnd second, educate yourself on ingredients and on fabrics that are bad for you and the planet.",

    "text": "Let me help you with that:\nThe Spyderco PITS.\nI was able to get my hands on the suggested Luna, but the shape of the blade did not tickle my fancy enough to pull the trigger.\nThere was an Anso knife that was very much to my liking until I realized that this was not a Fox manufactured one, but a hand made original Anso with a four figure price tag - which made me put it down gently and forget all about it.\nSince I was in the area, I also visited a shop where I bought a few knives in the past.\nThat guy accepts trade ins and sometimes has very interesting items.\nI confronted him with my very specific list with the Kizer and the Luna already crossed off.\nAfter a lot of thought, he gave up.\nWe talked, though.\nAnd he showed me a few knives.\nNothing came up.\nThere was a neck knife in a kydex sheath that I tried out.\nThe form of it was flirting with my hands so much it was obscene!\nI inquired about the price and instead of a number, he told me the blade steel was below par for what I want and usually buy.\nSo we also gave up on this, too.\nLucky me, I don't know what I would have done with a neck knife.\nWell, we had to go through all of this to get him to open the cabinet with the trade in items (my guess is he has a bigger margin on his regular stock so the trade ins always come last).\nPlaced before my weary eyes, on the counter of that glorified place of obtaining sharp steel, was a Rick Hinderer XM Slippy in OD Green.\nThe price he asked matched a beaten up model with scratches and notches, but this item was pre-owned by a collector that had it in a showcase.\nIt was in mint condition.\nFactory Grind, still razor sharp.\nThe thumbdisc was not even attached.\nNot a mark on it anywhere.\nI usually give a knife a few minutes in my hand, see how it sits in my pocket and play around with it for a bit, but this kind of felt like a no brainer.\nA brand-spanking-new Hinderer for half the retail price.\nSo now I blew my budget.\nBut on the sunny side of things: This one actually has titanium sidewalls - they are hidden under the G10, but technically it IS a non locking knife with titanium handles.\nNow I only have to figure out if the clips of the 3\" XM-18 also fit the slippy and get an aftermarket deep carry clip.\nI initially thought I might buy this one and just try and trade it for the Spyderco PITS, but I've spent a little time with it and I highly doubt that the Spydie will be the better alternative.",

    "text": "The model, actor and activist shares her earliest fashion memories, when she stopped letting her disability dictate her style and where she's been shopping lately.\n\nSince she first started modeling six years ago, Jillian Mercado has graced the cover of Teen Vogue , starred in campaigns for brands like Target and Nordstrom and has become a thought-leader in the fashion industry.\nThrough it all, she has used her platform to advocate for people with disabilities who historically haven't been represented or catered to in this space.\nAnd she's not limiting herself to just fashion: Mercado has crossed over to Hollywood with a role in \"The L Word\" reboot, \"The L Word: Generation Q,\" which was just renewed for a second season.\n\n\"My character on [The L Word] has nothing to do with my disability.\nShe just happens to have a disability.\nThat's it,\" Mercado tells Fashionista, noting that people with disabilities are still rarely represented in television and film (and that more often than not , they're played by able-bodied actors.)\nShe's taking what she's learned from working in fashion and using it to create the representation she didn't see growing up across different industries.\nBy pursuing both career paths, she believes she can better serve her community and push boundaries even further.\n\nMercado at the premiere of \"L Word: Generation Q\" in December 2019.\u00a0\n\nPhoto: Getty Images/David Livingston\n\nClothes have always played a part in Mercado's journey of self-discovery.\n(Her mother used to be a seamstress, and taught her how to sew.)\nThey still do.\nThe 32-year-old shared her earliest fashion memories, when she stopped letting her disability dictate her style and where she's been shopping lately.\u00a0\n\n\"My mom was a seamstress when she was my age.\nShe worked at a factory and was really into sewing and creating clothes.\nA lot of our childhood, my sisters and I had our own 'couture clothing' that was created by my mom.\nIt was such a good bonding time.\n\n\"My mom loves to go shopping and we always went shopping together.\nI remember buying bigger sizes [when I was growing up].\nIf I was an extra small my mom would get me a medium because at the time I was wearing braces.\nWe had to be creative and find something that was comfortable.\nBut also when I was younger it was crucial to me to not show that I had braces.\nI was really insecure about them.\nI was always thinking, 'What kind of clothes do I really like wearing?\nAnd what would make me look less disabled?'\n\n\"I stopped wearing braces around age 14.\nI was just so tired of not feeling like myself [in order] to cater to the world and thinking that if I change who I am, then the world will accept me.\nIn reality it should've been the other way around.\nI blame that on the representation that was around during that time \u2014 I never saw myself anywhere.\nIf I did, it was in commercials about cancer or something really sad.\nI [realized] I'd rather be me and be happy than be miserable in my own self and body.\n\n\"In the '90s, there were zero accessible clothing brands \u2014 or anything that represented my community, for that matter.\nBack then, I loved jean jackets and putting pins on them.\u00a0If you'd look at my photo albums [from] when I was little, that's all I wore.\nIt was very Justin Timberlake and Britney [Spears].\u00a0\n\n\"As I got older, I was always thinking, 'How do I become more independent?'\nMy mom would always say this phrase in Spanish that means, 'I'm not going to be here forever.'\nIt was kind of intense to hear [that] as a child, but it made me consider: If nobody is there to help me, how can I do things by myself?\nI would buy things thinking, 'Can I remove this and put this on myself?'\nI still go by that rule today.\n\n\"I've always liked going to stores physically and feeling the material, trying it on and seeing if it fits.\nSometimes you're looking at something and when you're putting it on it's a completely different outfit.\nSome of these stores are messy \u2014 there are hangers on the floor and that's aggravating because my wheels would get stuck in them or the clothes would get tracks on them and it's just embarrassing at that point.\n\n\"In my early twenties, I spent time at Club Monaco, H&M, Zara and Urban Outfitters.\nI was really into the office look.\nI tried to make it as grungy as possible.\nI would wear a blouse from Club Monaco paired with a leather jacket and black skinny jeans.\nI tried doing a blazer but it just didn't work for me because it looked too corporate.\nI loved wearing skinny black jeans \u2014 I still do.\nWhen I was living with my family, I always had someone to help me.\nIt's a process to put them on.\nIt would take me more than 30 minutes.\nThat was really aggravating because they were becoming harder to wear.\nI was interning, going to college and trying to have a social life.\nThey were interfering [with my life].\n\n\"I realized no one was going to help me.\nNo designer was going to figure out a creative way where we all can wear jeans.\nThat was always frustrating.\nI think it was around that time I created a list of things that I love doing and make me happy \u2014 going to the ballet, to the movies or hanging out with my friends.\nOne of them was working in fashion.\n\n\"I always enjoyed being creative in college.\nI interned at four or five places, and I would look at myself and think, 'I'd rather be in this environment than anything else I can even think of.'\nI wanted to shake things up in the industry because I didn't see anyone like myself becoming editors or photographers or anything behind the scenes.\nI wanted to get to a place where I could hire people like myself to be the people that I had been looking for.\nI knew they were out there in my heart and in my soul \u2014 they were just not given the opportunity to be in the limelight.\n\n\"I got my first Diesel campaign six years ago.\nI knew all along this was able to happen.\nBecause I studied marketing in college, I knew that people love money and this was making money.\nAnd that if I really committed myself to that anything was possible.\n\n\"It's been awesome working with Tommy Hilfiger [on campaigns for its adaptive fashion line].\nIt introduced the idea that big brands can cater to people who have disabilities and it doesn't have to be dramatic.\nA lot of companies say it's a lot of money, but that's honestly an excuse \u2014 you just have to be creative about it.\nHave a team with people who actually have disabilities to help you do it.\nI'm thankful that they at least started the conversation.\n\n\"My mom taught me how to sew, which is awesome.\nI'm pretty good at hemming pants, which comes in handy.\nI've tried to cut down shopping fast fashion, which is obviously a privilege.\nI live in Los Angeles right now and there are so many vintage shops.\nI do a lot of vintage or secondhand shopping at places like Wasteland and Squaresville.\nI go down Santa Monica Boulevard and there are so many vintage shops.\n\n\"I don't wear skinny jeans anymore, even though I would love to.\nMostly, I wear dresses or long skirts and crop tops.\nI still wear my leather jacket because I will never not wear that.\nIt's one of my favorite pieces.\nI pretty much don't wear bigger sizes anymore unless it's a comfy sweater or something.\n\n\"As long as I'm alive, I'm always going to advocate for [people with disabilities].\nCompanies really need to understand that we're here and we're not going anywhere.\nThey're losing a huge community of people and money.\nAs soon as they realize that they'll understand.\nAnd when they get there, they need to hire us in positions of power because you can't do [it] if we're not there.\nWe should have choices like everybody else has choices.\nThere's a petite section and there's a plus size section but honestly, those sections should be one.\nIt should all just be clothes.\u201d",

    "text": "\t\t\t\t\t\t...since I enjoyed the last thread in search of the not-quite-EDC light and it made me break with the list of what I thought I'd need in that light to make me happy (the Zebralight I chose has no internal charging which I initially wanted), I'm going to annoy you with another one of those.\nOnly now, things get turned around.\nInstead of providing an immaculate list of relevant specifications, I'll be horribly vague.\nSo in my active roster of duty I have the following Items:\n EDC: Olight S1RII Ti (winter edition).\nIt's the same as the normal S1RII, only it's got a titanium body and the emitter is MUCH warmer.\n3000k of oldschool flashlight yellowness, but with a turbo mode spitting out modern 850 Lumens.\nI love that one.\nIt's been with me every single day since I had it in the mail.\nIn my bag that I carry most of the time, I have the regular S1RII as a backup.\nThings I like about these two:\n\nThe UI suits my needs just fine.\nLow-Mid-High per normal operation, moonlight and turbo per easy 'special presses'.\n\nthe good balance of a large hotspot and spill, very good for EDC, but will reach way over the 100 yards mark in a pinch.\n\nI've not had this one very long, but I liked it from the moment I slid an 18650 cell into it and turned it on for the first time.\nI kept clear of all the guides and manuals on how the UI works and tried to figure it out myself.\nLo and behold: I mastered the muggle mode within mere moments.This one has a bit more juice than the Olight, it has a bigger reflector and a smaller hotspot, so it reaches further, stays on longer and while still being tiny, it's actually something that fills your hand while working with it.\nNot too large to hold it in your mouth, if you're into that.\nIn some ways, it is the exact opposite of the Olight.\nWhere the Olight comes with a UI that offers more modes close at hand (5 instead of 3), the Zebra comes with so many options to customize it that it's baffling.\nWhere the Olight comes with a set of nice-to-have extras (magnetic tailcap, magnetic charger, two way clip) the Zebra seems to focus on the job at hand (use the juice in the cell as good as possible to make light come out of the fat end) and do that exceptionally well.\nThe Olight with the sexy knurling around the barrel and the flashy beadblasted titanium seems to suggest to be more than a mere flashlight, it aspires to be a work of design and art.\nThe Zebra is a flashlight.\nNo doubt about that.\nIt looks a bit unique, but it's so flashlighty that no one could ever confuse it with anything else.\nSo the Zebralight hops in my bag when I know it's likely that I'll need a flashlight.\nMy Quest could be over here.\nI have my EDC and I have a slightly bigger one with more power.\nI also have spares I did not mention because they are sitting somewhere in the house waiting for the first power cut in decades.\nBut in the last thread I said that I'm a three flashlights kind of person.\nI said It's about having an EDC, a not-quite-EDC and a thrower.\nI claimed that I sometimes need to scan for deer which needs a 1000ft range before I let my dog off the leash.\nI also said that the kid in me requires a thrower because back then, the best light was the one that could shine further than the others.\nSo I went and got an Olight Javelot Pro.\nI always liked the looks of that one, especially in Coyote Tan.\nI found one for a ridiculously cheap price, so I had to get it.\nI toyed around with it for a few minutes, but realized that it's a bit too big for what I like it to do.\nIt won't fit into my coat pockets.\nAnd it's too expensive to have it 'just because'.\nSo I sold it on with a profit.\nAnd that money needs to go somewhere.\nI gave away my old Dereelight DVB v3 thrower, so ATM the Zebra is the flashlight that shines the furthest.\nSo what do all these words mean?\nI'm looking to get a flashlight that has me grinning when I pull it out of my coat pocket.\nMy intended budget is a two figure sum, but could stretch further if I really like what I see.\nI do have an unused 14500 and a pair of protected 18650s in my possession that have nowhere to go.\nObjects I looked at so far:\n-One of them LEP laserbeams.\nHUGE grin potential, but all I've found are north of 200 bucks and the used market does not hold any of them.\n-Thrunite Catapult v6.\nThis could be an obvious choice.\nIt has many things I like and fits the bill rather well.\n-Lumintop GT mini and GT micro.\nI don't like ramping that much, but the micro is so tiny, yet powerful that it intrigues me somewhat.\n-Prometheus Mini Turbo MKIII.\nToo weak.\nI mean, incredible numbers for the size.\nBut too weak for me to consider it.\nSo that's where you guys come in and suggest something I have not thought of, we start a discussion, I realize you've got a point and somewhere on this planet, someone packs a flashlight, writes my name on the parcel and puts it in the mail.",

    "text": "For a few years in my early 20s, I was a Jean Expert\u2122.\nI worked at American Eagle in my hometown mall and was an enthusiastic participant in the store\u2019s mandatory denim training.\nAround the fall of 2008, the chain embraced the resurrection of skinny jeans, and as a wee baby hipster determined to differentiate herself from anyone still savoring super-low-rise bootcut, I saw them as liberation from \u201cthe mainstream.\u201d\nNever mind that they were available everywhere.\nTo me skinny jeans equated freedom.\nWhich was ironic, because they felt anything but.\nUntil I met mom jeans.\n\nThe first time I saw super-high-rise jeans\u2014specifically, my best friend\u2019s pair of Cheap Mondays\u2014I was as shocked as I was intrigued.\nI immediately bought a pair.\nUnlike their low-rise counterparts, they highlighted the parts of myself I\u2019d come to believe should be strategically covered in billowy tank tops or several polos worn simultaneously, lest my body look imperfect.\nI\u2019d wear them with plain crewneck T-shirts and scarves or big, baggy sweaters.\nI wanted to show off how interesting and different I was, both in my penchant for vintage but also in my rejection of the trends of the moment.\nThese jeans let me do that.\n\nSure, millions of other people were wearing their denim high (and had never actually stopped).\nBut these jeans made me feel special .\nI was a Denim Expert who rejected regular old skinnies in favor of mom jeans, and that made me unique.\n\nI know now, of course, that I absolutely wasn\u2019t.\nAnd about a decade after their introduction to the mainstream, mom jeans have nestled their way into our hearts and closets, evolving from a derogatory nickname reserved to a bona fide trend.\n(My old employer even has a whole section dedicated to them .)\nThey now have straighter, roomier legs\u2014thank heavens\u2014that seem concerned with comfort over everything else.\nWhich suits me just fine: As a now 34-year-old woman who wants nothing more than to pour herself into a denim sack every morning out of sheer laziness, the embrace of mom jeans has helped cultivate the illusion of having style, despite really just wanting to dress like Sabrina Spellman circa 1996.\n\nThe thing is, as much as I loved the idea of a high-rise skinny, I was never (and still am not) totally comfortable wearing it.\nTo wiggle into jeans that are super-tight, that require maneuvering, that midday can make you want to abandon them completely for jogging pants or paper bag, isn\u2019t exactly a dream.\nYes, it felt cool not to worry about showing your underwear off if you so much bent down to tie your shoe, as would happen with a super low-rise, but it\u2019s even cooler to feel like you\u2019re cheating\u2014like your high rise and billowy legs symbolize a dedication to fashion over your allegiance to absolute comfort.\nAnd to be honest, I\u2019ve never felt better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a new development for me.\nSo much of my relationship with denim has hinged on what\u2019s \u201chot\u201d or \u201csexy\u201d or what other people (read \u201cmen\u201d) will like.\nAt no point in my journey, from retail to hipsterdom, did I allow myself to lean into what I really wanted: pants I could simply be a person in.\nEven then I would use mom jeans as a pejorative while trying to articulate what I was looking for, fit-wise, as if playing off the SNL sketch of the same name would beat naysayers to the punch and cancel out that I was, well, legitimately starting to dress like my own mother about 25 years ago.\n\nNow I\u2019m having a blast reliving a decade that I over-romanticize through pieces that are aligned with it.\nAnd I know this isn\u2019t something that\u2019s exclusive to me.\nLook around!\nWe\u2019re all ripped out of the Sears catalogue, circa 1998.\n\nAnd of course, I\u2019d like to say I\u2019ll stay there, that I\u2019ve found my niche and have no plans to abandon ship for the super-low-rise resurgence or stampede of \u201900s-era trends winding their way through runways and mall chains.\nGranted, in this moment I absolutely have.\nMom jeans are the enduring reminder that if you don\u2019t want to dress a particular way, you don\u2019t have to.\nYou can prioritize movement and space and comfort while still cultivating a style you feel best represents you.\n\nShould another incarnation of mom jeans step up to take that dream a little further, I\u2019m not above exploring it.\nBecause they may have resurfaced as a means of asserting one\u2019s aesthetic individuality, but they\u2019ve endured roughly three full decades.\nMeaning you can\u2014and can always\u2014go home to Mom again.\n\nAnne T.

    "text": "There are two kinds of jeans that get people really riled up: low-rise jeans and high-waist jeans .\nThere are plenty of other styles to choose from , but these are the real conversation starters\u2014the ones that everyone has an opinion on (in the case of the low-rise and its potential comeback), and everyone definitely has a preference.\n\nOver the past few years, shoppers have rediscovered the best high waisted jeans, which have shed their \"mom\" and \"dad\" reputation and have been embraced for their comfort and versatility .\nLike low-rise jeans, they\u2019re nostalgic, but unlike them, they feel timeless, worn by everyone from Fran Lebowitz to Gigi Hadid.\nAnd just like with any good tried-and-true wardrobe staple , each person swears by one brand that makes the best.\nEven a quick poll around the Glamour office revealed the sheer variety of options available on the market.\nAhead, we've rounded up their recommendations for the absolute best high waisted jeans.\n\nAll products featured on Glamour are independently selected by our editors.\nHowever, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nI'm a bit of a sucker for denim.\nI'm almost always down to splurge on a pair of vintage jeans from Etsy if I've never seen something like them before.\nAnd it takes a lot to catch my eye.\nSo I was very impressed by how much I loved this pair from Mott & Bow.\nThese jeans have the vintage wash that I'm obsessed with and are actually really comfortable which isn't the case with most of my other thrifted denim.\n\u2014 Tara Gonzalez , associate commerce editor\n\nI own a lot of different pairs of Levi's, but these are my favorite.\nI bought them on a whim a few years ago, during an Urban Outfitters sale.\nI had already tried the Wedgie fit and liked that it was so high and so fitted around the waist and butt\u2014plus slightly cropped at the leg, which is necessarily if you're five feet tall like me and don't ever get around to tailoring pants.\nI wear them at least once a week, if not multiple times\u2014with T-shirts in the spring and summer, and turtlenecks in the fall and winter.\nWhen I'm considering buying a top , the first thing I ask myself is: How would this look with my Wedgie jeans?\n(The answer, most of the time: amazing.)\n\u2014 Ana Colon , fashion editor\n\nI'm devoted to vintage jeans, but it can take years to track down the perfect pair.\nI've started relying on new, vintage- inspired brands to fill that void.\nThis pair from Reformation could pass for vintage (and it helps that the brand promotes sustainability and conscious production).\nI call them a \"Lady Jean,\" as they still have a relaxed vibe because of the light wash but they fit so perfectly they make me look put together no matter what I wear.\nThey're rigid, so it takes several wears before they start losing their shape, and the cropped length is perfect for showing off my shoes.\u2014 Bella Cacciatore, beauty associate\n\nEver since our fashion team convinced me I was someone who could pull off cropped flares (spoiler: everyone is someone who can wear them; even if you're plus-size like me), they've become a mainstay in my wardrobe.\nRight now, I'm loving this pair from Universal Standard.\nThey're more of a traditional bootcut, but they look incredible with the high-cut boots that are in season.\nThe best part?\nThe sizes go from 00 to 40.\u2014 Lindsay Schallon, senior beauty editor\n\nAs a fashion editor, I own way too many jeans.\nI've had the luxury of trying most of what's on the market, in addition to figuring out what fits into my own personal style.\nI've learned that non-stretch denim is a key ingredient for me\u2014I hate when the knees get baggy, or the waist or butt areas stretch out after one wear.\nA Gold E has create the perfect combination of high rise and non-stretch fabric in these pinch-waist jeans.\nI wear them at least once a week and they pair perfectly with a multitude of shoes because they hit right at the ankle.\u2014*Shilpa Prabhakar Nadella, fashion market director\n\nOn days I want to give my skinny jeans a rest, I can count on these Rolla\u2019s.\nThey fit my waist perfectly without giving me heartburn after lunch (just me?), and the silhouette makes me feel like I tried without having to\u2026well, try.\nI wear them with a plain white tee when it\u2019s warm out and a cropped cardigan on colder days.\u2014 Shanna Shipin, commerce editor",

    "text": "I Never Wear Denim, but I Make an Exception for These $90 Jeans\n\nAs a plus-size petite woman, jeans are never going to be my best friend, but these have become a close acquaintance.\n\nAll products featured on Glamour are independently selected by our editors.\nHowever, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nMost people describe their style aesthetic as \u201calways wears black\u201d or \u201cfree-spirited, could-be-at-a-music-festival-anytime boho chic.\u201d\nMine is \u201cnever wears pants.\u201d\nI'm like the opposite of Tobias Funke in Arrested Development, because you will rarely catch me in denim .\n\nI'm a petite (5'1\"), plus-size (18/20) woman with a long torso and short legs.\nPants always ride too low on my hips and are so long they could be a denim wedding-gown train, so I stick to dresses , skirts, and jumpsuits that work on me proportionately.\nI actually boycotted pants for 10 years and only recently came around to them again .\nAnd that's largely in part to Universal Standard\u2019s Seine high-rise skinny jeans .\n\nUniversal Standard Seine High-Rise Skinny Jeans\n\nUniversal Standard\n\n$90\n\nI had my first encounter with these jeans at Universal Standard's showroom in New York City.\nI was trying on dozens of pants for a different Glamour story , and was skeptical at first.\nThey're true skinny jeans, which can be too constricting and make me feel like a sausage.\nBut immediately I noticed how these struck a delicate balance of adhering to every curve of my body, yet were forgiving enough that I didn\u2019t have to hop into them to get them up.\nThey slid on smoothly and had enough stretch that I could do high kicks, dance, squat, and\u2014most important\u2014sit in them without feeling constricted.\nAnd the 24\" inseam meant they actually were ankle jeans on my very short legs.\n\nThe term \u201c high-waist \u201d can vary across brands, but Universal Standard's Seine hits a few inches above my belly button, but not touching my bra.\nIt's also able to hold my stomach in so it doesn\u2019t jiggle about, and my flat ass doesn\u2019t look so teeny-tiny from the way it sculpts in the back from the bit of stretch.\n\nSeine High-Rise Skinny Jeans Petite\n\nUniversal Standard\n\n$90\n\nThe material is soft and comfortable, but it's also sturdy enough that I can wear these jeans a few times in a row without them sagging at all.\nI get why it won a Glamour Plus-Size Fashion Award .\nI have the Seine in distressed blue, but am contemplating buying a pair of sleek black ones next.\n\nI tend to wear longer shirts with these jeans just because I don\u2019t like seeing a stomach outline, but one perk of the design is that it has little distressed lines across the torso that pull the focus away from that.\nEven after a few washes, the jeans have held their shape and haven\u2019t pilled or ripped between the thighs.\nI dried them on low once and they shrink slightly, but if you wash cold and hang-dry as Universal Standard recommends, they should be fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best part about these plus-size petite jeans is that they aren\u2019t just for plus-size people or just for petite people.\nUniversal Standard makes its Seine jeans for everyone in sizes 0 to 36 in petite (24\" inseam), regular (27\"), and tall (32\").\nIt's also available in five different washes.\nI can recommend them just as easily to my size-12, 5'7\" friend as to my size-2, 5'2\" friend.\nAnd I have, and I will continue doing so.\n\nSeine High-Rise Skinny Jeans in Petite\n\nUniversal Standard\n\n$90\n\nAs it is finally starting to feel like fall outside, I anticipate wearing these at least weekly with a chunky sweater, oversized button-downs (I\u2019m partial to men\u2019s shirts with bold prints like this pear number from ASOS , and maybe even short summer dresses when it gets colder and tights won\u2019t be warm enough.\nSure, I may never identify as a \u201cjeans person,\u201d but these have made me at least jeans curious.\n\nAs a true test, I wore these jeans as I wrote this article on my couch instead of immediately changing into pajamas.\nI didn\u2019t even notice until I looked down and was shocked to see denim instead of sweatpants, and that\u2019s the best mix-up to happen since Annie and Hallie met in The Parent Trap .\n\nAlyse Whitney is the senior food editor at Rachael Ray Every Day and a longtime contributor at Glamour.\nFollow her @alysewhitney.",

    "text": "This in-depth guide to jeans for short men contains everything you need to know to wear jeans that fit and flatter your build (even if you're a shorter guy).\n\nRegardless of your height, jeans might be the number one most important wardrobe staple any guy can own.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll break down exactly what you need to know before you buy another pair of jeans.\n\nOn the other hand, if you buy too far into the skinny jean trend, you'll look like your pants are painted on.\nNot a good look, either!\n\nLuckily, we're going to help you find that perfect balance.\nWe'll talk about:\n\nAt TMM, we\u2019re strong believers that \u201cslim fit\u201d jeans are the best option for most guys.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve never considered yourself a \u201cslim\u201d guy.\nA lot of us shorter gents are stocky, too.\nThe big thighs and broad shoulders don\u2019t seem like they\u2019d do too well in anything \u201cslim fit.\u201d\n\nWell, you\u2019d be surprised.\n\nSlim-fit jeans work for stocky guys , too.\nOftentimes, relaxed-fit jeans cover the thighs but leave a ton of extra fabric around the calves.\nThis just makes short guys look shorter (and stocky guys look stockier).\n\nThis is what we're trying to avoid!\n\nMany slim-fit jeans just taper toward the bottom, removing some of that extra fabric that\u2019s only making you look shorter and stockier.\n\nIf you really do have m-a-s-s-i-v-e t-h-i-g-h-s then you'll want to check out athletic fit or tapered fit jeans.\n\nSo, as a rule, remove as much fabric from the equation as you can without your jeans pulling tight across your skin.\n\nHere, we have an example of Brock with a slim-fit pair of jeans on the left and a skinny-stretch pair of jeans on the right.\n\nKeep in mind, there's no standard definition of \u201cslim\u201d or \u201cskinny\u201d so these terms vary widely between brands.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is to avoid baggy pants.\nFirst of all, they don\u2019t work on any guy.\nBut the damage is so much worse for shorter guys.\n\nSo keeping \u2018em slim is our first rule, but how else can you tell which pair of jeans is going to be the perfect fit?\n\nLet\u2019s go from top to bottom and see what works best for you.\n\nThe Waist\n\nWhen choosing a pair of pants, you want them to stay up without a belt.\nBelts are great for an extra quarter or half-inch and there, but any more than that and the fabric will start to fold around the waistband.\n\nIf your jeans are too big, this will create odd-looking folds in the front and seat of your pants.\n\nBut while you don\u2019t want to go too loose, you definitely don\u2019t want to go too tight either.\nUltimately, these jeans should be comfortable.\n\nIf your jeans push into your stomach when you sit down, they\u2019re probably too tight.\nDoing the classic \u201cunbutton the pants after dinner\u201d move is best saved for Thanksgiving when you really go all-out.\nIf you\u2019re unbuttoning after that Chinese chicken salad, well, your pants are too tight.\n\nThe Hips\n\nGetting the right fit in the hips is critical.\nYour jeans need to fit around the widest part of your lower half.\n\nIf you get a pair of jeans that fit in the waist but are too tight on your hips, you risk having a major blowout every time you bend down to pick anything up (some of our tips are for style, others are for preserving your dignity).\n\nGo too loose on the hips and your butt will essentially disappear into the extra fabric.\nMany guys already don\u2019t have much rear-end to begin with, so the last thing you want to do is accentuate the saggy-butt.\n\nThe Rise\n\nThe rise often goes overlooked, but it\u2019s one of the most important measurements when getting a pair of jeans you love.\n\nUntil you really spend time learning about the measurement of jeans, the rise is just one of those je-ne-sais-quoi factors.\n\nThe front rise is the measurement from the waist to the crotch seam, and the back rise just starts from the rear of the waistband.\n\nThere are typically three types of rises: low, mid and high.\n\nLow rise pants usually have around 8 inches of space between the crotch and waist, whereas high rise pants can have up to 12 inches.\n\nWe generally recommend going with mid-rise.\nLow rise just doesn\u2019t work in a smart-casual wardrobe (but if you follow many Instagram accounts, you\u2019ll see tons of super-buff guys wearing skin-tight low rise jeans all the time).\n\nHigh rise jeans work well for older gents as they sit higher on the waist and can flatten the stomach.\n\nHere at The Modest Man, we\u2019re not really game for chasing trends.\n\nMen in the \u201840s wore high-waisted dress slacks that were loose-fitting, but just 20 years later, Sonny and Cher were stomping around in their low rise jeans.\n\n20 years after that, MC Hammer brought back the high rise look.\nThen Britney Spears and NSYNC took low rise to new limits.\n\nSo, if you can\u2019t tell, in the world of fashion, there aren\u2019t any set rules for what looks great.\n\nWe do think that style is timeless, though.\nSo we generally recommend you stick with mid-rise pants.\n\nThe Leg\n\nThe leg is the best place to cut out as much excess fabric as you can.\nWe\u2019re fans of slim fit jeans and even skinny jeans on guys with slimmer legs.\n\nEven if you\u2019ve never thought of yourself as a \u201cslim\u201d guy, you\u2019d be surprised at how much taller and slimmer a pair of these jeans will make you look.\n\nLook for a gradual taper from the thigh to the ankle.\nKeep too much bulk and you\u2019ll end up looking shorter and stockier.\n\nSubtle taper from the thigh down to the ankle = perfection | @ericnycstyle\n\nThe idea is to have your pants match the shape of your legs.\nIf your ankles are the size of your thighs, you have a medical condition.\nThat\u2019s not the sort of look we\u2019re going for.\nThe taper just matches more closely what your legs actually look like.\n\nThe Leg Opening\n\nThe leg opening is the diameter of the ankle of the pant leg.\n\nFrom time to time, you may see that the measurement is of a circumference, though in most cases you\u2019ll see it\u2019s the number of inches of the ankle when your pants are laid flat.\n\nThe leg opening measurement is usually taken across the pants leg while laid flat.\n\nSmaller leg openings mean more taper.\nIf you\u2019re wearing regular or relaxed fit jeans, you may find that the leg opening is the same as the width of the thigh.\nIf that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re in extra fabric territory.\n\nGenerally, you want to look for a leg opening that is smaller than the measurement of the thigh.\nThat ensures you\u2019re getting a pair of pants that will slim your profile and lengthen your legs.\n\nAnd remember, unless you\u2019re a cowboy, stay away from leg openings that get wider.\nWhile they\u2019re great for wearing over white platform patent leather boots with fish swimming in the heel, boot-cut jeans rarely look good in a casual outfit.\n\nPants Break\n\nThe \u201cbreak\u201d of your pants refers to the amount that extra fabric sits atop your shoes.\nLonger pants have more break, while shorter pants have little to no break.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole spectrum on which you can figure out which pant-break you prefer.\nIf you\u2019re like The Modest Man, you have a few different pairs of jeans in varying sizes with varying breaks.\n\nThe spectrum looks like this:\n\nIt's not a perfect science, but when in doubt, go with slight break.\n\nShorter guys should steer away from full break jeans but often don't.\nThis is because most jeans come with a 30+ inch inseam (if not 32 or even 34).\n\nThis it problematic because full break tends to make us look even shorter.\nSo you need to cuff your jeans or get them hemmed to a shorter length.\n\nThe \u201cslight break\u201d look is perfect for most modern day guys.\n| @thegentwithin\n\nA slight break is a great spot to aim for.\nNo break jeans are currently in fashion, so opting for that length will give you a cool and trendy look that's perfect for shorter guys.\n\nBottom line: you can't go wrong with slight break or no break, but stay away from full break and stacking.\n\nShould you cuff your jeans?\n\nCuffing is a casual move, so it's not really appropriate for super formal settings (like a business casual lunch meeting, for example).\n\nBut if you like the look, go for it!\n\nSometimes just turning the cuff up once is enough for a casual, slight break look.\n\nA lot of times you\u2019ll hear the advice that cuffing your jeans makes short guys look shorter, but we disagree.\nPlenty of shorter guys do it all the time and look fantastic.\n\nThe key is to make sure the cuff isn't too big.\nGo with 1-2 inches, not 3-4 inches.\n\nCommon Jeans Fit Problems for Short Men\n\nSo many nation-wide clothing brands ignore us guys under 5\u20198\u201d.\nIf they didn\u2019t, Brock never would\u2019ve started this site in the first place.\n\nAll too often, shorter guys end up paying extra for alterations.\n\nThis is money well spent, but if you want to shop smarter, here\u2019s what to watch out for when shopping as a man of modest height.\n\nIssue #1: Jeans Are Too Long\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen it a thousand times.\nMost brands don\u2019t make inseams shorter than 30 inches, so almost everything you pick up is too long.\n\nNo matter what else you have going for you, this all-too-common fit problem is killing your image.\n\nNot everyone goes for the cuff look.\nPlus, you don\u2019t want to buy a pair of jeans knowing you have to always have them rolled.\n\nSo you could get the hemmed at the tailor.\nIt usually costs between $10 and $20 dollars, depending on where you live.\n\nIf you do get your jeans hemmed by a tailor, make sure you ask them to keep the original hem.\n\nHopefully it'll help you\u00a0find out which pair of jeans is right for you.\n\nIssue #2: Details Are All Off\n\nIf you\u2019ve never bought a pair of pants from a brand that specialized in clothing for shorter gents, you may never have noticed this one.\n\nEven if you find that one magic pair of jeans in the mall with a 28\u201d inseam, everything else is still scaled up to fit someone larger than you.\n\nEven if you cuff/hem jeans that are made for a taller guy, the details might still be off.\nLook at how low those back pockets are!\n\nHave you ever had a pair of pants that fit otherwise but had pockets that were placed way too low on your butt?\nThese problems can\u2019t be fixed with a simple trip to a tailor.\n\nSo when you try on jeans in the fitting room or at home, make sure the details (like pocket size and placement) are right for your build.\n\nIssue #3: Jeans Are Too Baggy\n\nUnless your name is Fred Durst,\u00a0steer clear of baggy jeans.\n\nActually, if your name is Fred Durst, you should steer clear of baggy jeans too.\n\nFor us modest men, baggy jeans just make us look like we\u2019re wearing somebody else\u2019s pants, as if we got a hand-me-down from our big brother.\n\nIn the best of situations, baggy jeans hide your manly figure.\nIn the worst of situations, baggy jeans make you look like a middle-school kid.\n\nOur advice?\nAvoid relaxed fit jeans at all cost.\n\nIssue #4: Rise is Too Low\n\nLow rise jeans aren\u2019t flattering for most body types.\nThey look great for young guys under 25 who have six-pack abs and jacked pecs.\n\nLow rise jeans also work great for taller guys with long legs and short torsos because they visually lengthen the torso.\n\nThe problem is, these jeans tend to make your legs look stubbier.\nThis isn\u2019t ideal for us shorter gents.\n\nTo make up for the shortness, some guys will hike up the waist, which just tightens things around the crotch\u2026 that\u2019s even worse than looking like you have short legs.\n\nNormal or mid-rise is the best option for most guys.\n\nFor guys over 45, higher rise jeans can also work out well.\nThey often maintain a clean, straight line through the hip and can keep your stomach flattened, ultimately giving you more height.\n\nWhere to Buy Jeans for Shorter Guys\n\nYou deserve a pair of jeans that was built for your body type.\nToday, there are more options than ever for shorter guys to find the perfect pair.\n\nKeep in mind, it's still hard to find shorter jeans in stores, so we highly recommend shopping online instead of going to the mall.\n\nAlso, some stores like Uniqlo is offer free same-day hemming in their stores so you can get the right fit without heading to a tailor.\n\nNow that you understand how jeans for shorter men should fit, you\u2019ll be able to find the perfect pair in no time.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be afraid to pick up multiple pairs after you\u2019ve found a fit you love.\nAt the least, we think guys should have two great pairs of jeans \u2013 one dark wash and one light (or black if that's more your color).",
