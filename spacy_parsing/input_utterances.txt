The MS400 isolate very well considering the comfort tradeoff. They won't quite keep up with the (comparatively) head-crushing K181s or the vast majority of IEMs but the isolation is more than good enough for daily use. I did not feel the need to raise the volume during my commute, though the tiniest details were occasionally obscured by intruding noise. Leakage is non-existent thanks to the soft pads and compliant fit.

The lambskin earpads provide a surprisingly good coupling with the ear for a supraaural headphone, resulting in isolation that only just yields to that of the Phiaton MS400

The soft pads and moderate clamping force result in impressive isolation, up there with the harder-clamping HFI-450 and much larger Pro 650.

The soft pads provide a moderate amount of isolation – enough to make music enjoyable on the go but definitely not adequate for the subway or an airplane. The level of isolation is not at all different from what is provided by similar-size wired sets such as the Sennheiser PX200-II and Denon AH-P372.

The isolation of the Crossfade LP is on par with other portable circumaural sets from companies such as JVC and Panasonic. Like the similarly-priced Monster Beats and Phiaton MS400s, they don’t quite reach the passive attenuation level of the HD25-1 and P5 but do perform very well out and about.

While the fit of the Beats Solo is very similar to that of the HD25-1, isolation suffers slightly as a result of the lighter clamping force. The isolation of the Solo is somewhere between the looser-fitting Phiaton MS400 larger V-Moda Crossfade LP – not class-leading but plentiful for use on the go.
